To run the selfbot make sure you have python
3.8 or up or else this may not work correctly!

Place your token in the config.json file

To get you discord token you can go to discord.com and open inspect
element in there you should see a network tab somewhere click on it lastly
send a message to any channel or dm and once you send it you should see a new post request
called messages in the network tab click on it and scroll till you find authorisation copy and paste the authorisation/token
into the config

run the install.bat to install all the librarys needed to run the bot!
if you get an error saying discord was not found during the install.bat
dont worry its just looking for the discord.py library

then run the run.bat file after the install is finished!
