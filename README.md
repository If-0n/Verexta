# Download
## Installion With Executable
I will make an exe for each update except for hotfixes so if the
latest version says hotfix you will have to go back to a regular update

To install go to the releases and click the version you want (cant be a hotfix)
Step 1) download the zip that does not have the word SRC in it.
Step 2) Extract the zip
Step 3) Double click the executable

easy.
